# Assignment's Purpose:

The purpose of the assignment is to "...help you understand that classes should encapsulate data and behavior around that data. Many developers (even those with years of experience) tend to create classes that are purely data containers, and other classes that are purely behavior (methods) providers. This is not object-oriented programming but more procedural programming. Such programs are very fragile where any change breaks the code.".

# Additional Requirements

1) 100% code coverage (all passing)
2) Separate files into folders when it makes sense
3) Follows coding standards in syllabus
4) README.md
5) Submitted via GitHub
